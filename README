This is my scons build scripts for embedded processors.
Although it's especially designed for MCUSH project,
they are still organized as two independent repositories, 
so commericial customers can download this toolkit quickly
and don't need to download the whole MCUSH repository.


current supports:
* STM32F1
* STM32F2
* STM32F4
* STM32L1
* MSP430F47163
* ATMEGA128
 

try ./install to make symbolic links to ~/.scons
